story: 'Calathea zebrina (the Zebra Plant) is a an evergreen perennial from Brazil.'
---<em><strong>Calathea zebrina</strong></em> (the Zebra Plant) is a tropical evergreen perennial in the family Marantaceae from Brazil. They are non-toxic and fuzzy pet safe, as well as reptile safe. Zebra plants produce white to purple flower clusters as well as shimmery, velvety feeling leaves with variegated bright and dark green tops and reddish-purple undersides. Leaves move slightly with the sun as the day goes on and at night will stand up and fold together resembling hands in prayer. In maturity, plants can grow to be up to 3 feet tall and leaves can eventually grow to 18 inches in length with proper care. Plant will arrive in a 3.5 inch pot, fully rooted. Plants will be 8 - 12 inches tall from the soil line.

Species likes to be indoors & cannot handle temps below 61 degrees F. Cold hardy outdoors year round in Zones 11 - 12 in shade. Normal room temperature inside is ideal. Plants prefer bright indirect light and will not do well in full sun. Soil should be kept moist in Summer and does not like to dry out. These plants do not like chlorine, so be sure to read the care guide to ensure proper watering. Fertilize twice a month during the growing season from Spring to Fall. Mist or place on a tray of rocks or pebbles to increase humidity. See our care guide for more detailed instructions.

Unboxing Instructions: When plant arrives, pot will be in a bag or wrapped to reduce soil loss, and taped to the bottom of the box to prevent the plant from banging around in transit. Slide a sharp knife or pair of scissors under the pot to cut the tape and free plant from the box, being careful not to cut yourself. Continue to remove paper and packaging materials and cut out of bag or wrapping and water thoroughly. Repot with appropriate peat based soil when needed. Plants have delicate leaves which may be damaged in transit, but once established in their new pot they will push out new leaves rapidly and should be pruned to keep up their beautiful appearance.
